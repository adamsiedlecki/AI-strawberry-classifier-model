Just some info that may help in the future

1. Before using tensorflow you need to check Python version. I used 3.6.5, the newest didn't work.
2. You need to have pip
3. Pip probably have to be newest
4. pip install tensorflow
5. pip install -q pyyaml h5py  # Required to save models in HDF5 format
6. Install CUDA Toolkit 10.1 from Nvidia - the newest doesn't work

As far this program has about 65% accuracy  on current dataset. I guess that is not bad, because I started learning TF last night.
